            <p class="ess">Executive Summary</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">G</span>Child and infant mortality rates in Africa pose significant challenges to achieving Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being. Analysis reveals a strong correlation between mortality rates and vaccination coverage among children under five and under fifteen, indicating that improving vaccination can lead to reduced mortality. Additionally, increased assistance from skilled professionals during childbirth is linked to lower maternal death rates, highlighting the importance of skilled care in improving health outcomes. The leading causes of infant deaths include birth asphyxia, trauma, and prematurity, with Nigeria identified as needing substantial efforts to reduce neonatal mortality rates. Despite these challenges, there is encouraging evidence of a dramatic decline in mortality rates over the years, alongside notable public health successes such as the fight against malaria.

                    <h2>Vaccination Coverage and Child Mortality in Africa</h2>
                   <p>
                    The analysis of vaccination coverage in relation to under-five (U5) and under-fifteen (U15) mortality rates in Africa reveals a significant negative correlation, with a correlation coefficient of -0.25 and a p-value of 0.00, indicating strong statistical significance. This suggests that higher vaccination coverage is associated with lower mortality rates among these age groups, emphasizing the critical role of immunization in improving child health outcomes. The findings align with global health literature that underscores vaccination as a vital intervention in reducing disease-related morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The results highlight the urgent need for enhanced vaccination efforts to mitigate preventable deaths and support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals related to health and well-being. Given the substantial impact of vaccination on mortality rates, targeted strategies to increase coverage could significantly contribute to improving child survival rates across the continent.
